# Kx022-1020

I have taken the Kx022-1020 library written by Goran and made only minor modifications to the library structure and content.

The SmartOled library written by Goran is a sparkfun original library, so i have taken this and modified it to suit small screens like the 64x32 ID107HR screen (using modifications from Goran). See https://github.com/micooke/sparkfun_OLED -or- https://github.com/micooke/squix78_OLED for small screen compatible OLED libraries.

I am not using the SmartOled library directly as the original source is for Arduino, which was modified to mbed then back to Arduino.

Enjoy!
